> A free, modern, fully editable church website — no WordPress, no backend, no monthly fees.
> Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS, deployed on Netlify, managed through a built-in admin panel.

## Quick Start (5 Steps)

**Step 1 — Use this template**
Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page on GitHub, then choose "Create a new repository." Name it after your church.

**Step 2 — Deploy to Netlify**
Click the **Deploy to Netlify** button above (or go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com), connect your GitHub account, and import your new repo). Netlify will build and publish the site automatically — free tier is plenty.

**Step 3 — Edit `config.json`**
Open `config.json` in your repo and fill in your church's name, address, phone, email, social links, and giving URL. The website reads this file on every load and populates itself automatically.

**Step 4 — Set up the admin panel**
- Open `/admin.html` on your live site
- Log in with the default password: `faithag2026` *(change this immediately — see below)*
- Go to **Church Settings** and enter your GitHub username and repo name
- Generate a GitHub token (see instructions below) and paste it into the token field
- Click **Save & Publish All** — your site updates in ~30 seconds

**Step 5 — Upload your logo and hero photo**
- Replace `logo 2.png` in the repo with your church's logo (keep the same filename, or update it in `index.html`)
- Upload a photo named `hero-bg.jpg` — it will appear as the hero background automatically

## Admin Panel

Visit `/admin.html` on your live site.

| Tab | What You Can Do |
|---|---|
| **Events** | Add, edit, delete upcoming events |
| **Announcement** | Toggle the top banner on/off, edit message |
| **Sermons** | Update featured sermon, YouTube embed, speaker |
| **Church Settings** | Edit all config.json values (name, address, social, GitHub settings) |
| **Change Password** | Generate a new SHA-256 password hash |

### Default Password
```
faithag2026
```
Change it immediately: go to **Change Password**, generate a hash, then replace `STORED_HASH` in `admin.html`.

### Publishing Changes
Click **"Save & Publish All"** — the admin panel pushes all JSON files to GitHub via the API, and Netlify redeploys in ~30–60 seconds.

---

## GitHub Token Setup

Required once per browser to enable publishing from the admin panel.

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)
2. Click **Generate new token** → give it a name (e.g. *Church Admin Panel*)
3. Set **Repository access** → Only selected repositories → your church repo
4. Under **Permissions**: set **Contents** to **Read and write** (Metadata is auto-selected)
5. Click **Generate token**, copy it
6. Paste into the green token bar in the admin panel — it saves to your browser automatically

---

## Changing the Admin Password

1. Open the admin panel → **Change Password** tab
2. Type your new password and click **Generate Hash**
3. Copy the hash string
4. Edit `admin.html` on GitHub → find `STORED_HASH` near the top of the `<script>` block
5. Replace the existing hash value with your new one
